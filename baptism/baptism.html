        <h2>Baptism</h2>
        <p>
          The word Baptism comes from the Greek word <strong>βαπτίζω (baptizo)</strong>, which means "To immerse."
          This is significant because biblical baptism always involved full immersion in water, as seen in the example of Jesus’ own baptism.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The Bible says in 
          <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/JHN.3.5.KJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            John 3:5
          </a>:  
          <i>“Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”</i>  
          This means that water baptism is a crucial step in spiritual rebirth.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          In the Book of Acts, when people repented and believed in Jesus, they were immediately baptized in His name. 
          <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/ACT.2.38.KJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            Acts 2:38
          </a> states:  
          <i>“Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.”</i>  
          This shows that baptism is not just symbolic but also for the remission (forgiveness) of sins.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Why Baptism in Jesus' Name?</h3>
        <p>
          Every recorded baptism in the New Testament was performed in the name of Jesus Christ.  
          The apostles, following Jesus’ instructions, baptized new believers in His name as shown in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/ACT.8.16.KJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acts 8:16</a> – The believers in Samaria were baptized in Jesus' name.</li>
          <li><a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/ACT.10.48.KJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acts 10:48</a> – Peter commanded Cornelius and his household to be baptized in the name of the Lord.</li>
          <li><a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/ACT.19.5.KJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acts 19:5</a> – Paul rebaptized disciples of John the Baptist in the name of Jesus.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Baptism as Part of Salvation</h3>
        <p>
          Jesus' final command before ascending into heaven was to preach the gospel and baptize believers.  
          <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/MRK.16.16.KJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            Mark 16:16
          </a> states:  
          <i>“He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.”</i>  
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Baptism is more than just an outward expression of faith; it is a biblical requirement for salvation. 
          As Paul explains in  
          <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/ROM.6.3-4.KJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            Romans 6:3-4
          </a>,  
          baptism unites us with Jesus in His death, burial, and resurrection.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Are You Ready to Be Baptized?</h3>
        <p>
          If you believe in Jesus Christ and desire to have your sins washed away, now is the time to be baptized in His name.
          Just as the early church did, you too can take this step of faith and obedience.
