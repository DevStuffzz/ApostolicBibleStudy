      Apostolic Bible Studies welcome! We're happy you're here, discovering the
      vibrant principles of Apostolic Pentecostal faith. As you navigate our
      studies, we invite you to live the transforming principles of the Bible
      and the unique characteristics of Apostolic Pentecostalism, grounded in
      the transforming power of Jesus Christ. Apostolic Pentecostalism is one of
      the currents within Christianity that professes the faith and traditions
      of the early church as recorded in the New Testament. The movement of
      Apostolic Pentecostalism heavily focuses on the full gospelâ€”namely, on
      repentance, baptism by the name of Jesus, and receiving the infilling of
      the Holy Spirit. It is a movement founded upon the belief in the unity of
      God, believing Jesus Christ to be the one true God, made known in the
      flesh. It is not in accordance with traditional Trinitarian doctrine,
      practicing the biblical truth that God is one, and that Jesus is the
      manifestation of the one God. Pentecostalism, as one of the significant
      aspects of the Apostolic faith, focuses on the importance of the gifts of
      the Spirit and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit in the believer's
      life. Among these gifts is the gift of speaking in tongues, which is the
      sign of being filled with the Holy Spirit. At the heart of Apostolic
      Pentecostalism is a personal and intimate relationship with Jesus Christ.
      We believe that every believer is called to be holy and sanctified,
      following in Christ's example and spreading His love and truth to other
      people. Our guide is the Bible, and its principles are the supports upon
      which we build our lives. Our heart's desire is to give you the wisdom and
      knowledge to live your faith authentically and boldly, as the first
      Apostles. Whether you are beginning your walk or have been walking in
      faith for decades, we feel that God's Word has something dynamic to say to
      you today. Thank you for stopping by Apostolic Bible Studies. May you be
      blessed as you study the teachings of Scripture and come to experience the
      life-altering power of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
