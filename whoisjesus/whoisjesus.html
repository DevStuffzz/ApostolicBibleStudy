    <h2>Who is Jesus?</h2>
    <br />

    <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/JHN.1.1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
      with God, and the Word
      was God. (John 1:1, KJV)</a><br />

    <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/JHN.1.14">And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,
      (and we beheld his
      glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace
      and truth.(John 1:14, KJV)</a>
    <br /><br />
    Simply put, Jesus is this flesh that is talked about in John chapter one.
    He is God incarnate, and was truly man and truly God. Jesus is not a
    separate person from the Father; He is the manifestation of the one true
    God, who revealed Himself in the flesh. In
    <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/JHN.14.9">John 14:9</a>, Jesus declares, "He that hath seen
    me hath seen the Father." This
    speaks to the understanding that Jesus, in His entirety, is the Father
    made visible. Jesus is not one of three co-equal persons but the full and
    complete expression of God’s nature in one person.

    <br />
    <br />
    As the One God, Jesus fully embodies the divine nature and purpose of
    God’s plan for salvation. Through His death, burial, and resurrection, He
    provided the means for humanity to be reconciled with God. In
    <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/1TI.3.16">1 Timothy 3:16</a>, it says, "And without
    controversy great is the mystery of godliness:
    God was manifest in the flesh." This is a clear declaration that the
    eternal God, the Creator, was revealed in the person of Jesus Christ.
    There is no distinction between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as
    separate persons in the Godhead; rather, these are different roles or
    manifestations of the one God. Jesus, as the Son, was God Himself coming
    to earth to fulfill the work of salvation.

    <br />
    <br />
    In
    <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/JOH.1.14">John 1:14</a>, it states, "And the Word was made
    flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we
    beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full
    of grace and truth." This emphasizes that Jesus is the Word, the eternal
    Logos, made flesh. He is the full revelation of God’s will to humanity.
    Jesus did not merely represent God; He was God in flesh.

    <br />
    <br />
    Thus, we baptize in the name of Jesus because He is the revealed name of
    God (<a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/ACT.2.38">Acts 2:38</a>). In
    <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/MAT.28.19">Matthew 28:19</a>, when Jesus commanded His
    disciples to baptize in the name of the
    Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, He was speaking of the name of Jesus, the
    only name by which we are saved. Jesus, being the name of the Father, Son,
    and Holy Ghost, signifies the fullness of the Godhead in one name.

    <br />
    <br />
    The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Jesus Christ (<a class="scripture"
      href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/COL.2.9">Colossians 2:9</a>), and He is the only mediator between God and man.
    Jesus is not a lesser
    being but the manifestation of the eternal God Himself. In Him, we find
    all the fullness of deity, and in His name, we have salvation.

    <br />
    <br />
    In
    <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/JOH.10.30">John 10:30</a>, Jesus states, "I and my Father
    are one." This oneness speaks to the
    unity of God in Jesus Christ. It is not a division of persons but the
    unity of the one God, manifest in flesh to redeem mankind. This is the
    simple truth that is revealed all throught scripture: there is one God,
    and that one God is revealed fully in Jesus Christ.

    <br />
    <br />
    Thus, when we worship Jesus, we worship the one true God, who is both our
    Savior and our Creator. The plan of salvation in Jesus is the culmination
    of God's eternal purpose, revealed to us in the person of Christ. Through
    Him, we find life, reconciliation, and eternal hope.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>So is Jesus the Son of God, or is he God?</h2>
    <b>Both.</b><br />
    In ancient dialect the term Son of simply meant has charictaristics of
    God. God's law requires death in place of sin
    <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/ROM.6.23.KJV">(Romans 6:23)</a>. However since every single
    person has sinned
    <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/ROM.3.23.KJV">(Romans 3:23)</a>, God had to robe himself in
    flesh
    <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/1TI.3.16">(1 Timothy 3:16)</a>
    and come down to earth, in order to be his own perfect vessel. This
    distinction between the Father and the Son simple refers to the difference
    between two manifestations of God, both as God and as man. There is but
    one God.
    <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/DEU.6.4">(Deuteronomy 6:4)</a>
    <br /><br />
    <h2>Jesus as a human</h2>
    Jesus was in every way human like us, however he lived without sin. This
    flesh remained obidient unto death, so God highly exhaulted him, and gave
    him the Name above all names
    <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/PHP.2.9.KJV">(Philippians 2:9)</a>. Jesus was born in the
    town of Bethleham, and was the son of Mary and
    Joseph. His parents were engaged at the time, and an angel came to Mary
    telling her that she would give birth to Jesus, the Son of God, despite
    her being still a virgin.
    <a class="scripture" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/LUK.1.26-35">(Luke 1:26-35)</a>
    <br><br>
